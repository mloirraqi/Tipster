## Notes

My biggest challenge was trying to get multiple images to load in the main menu loading screen as well as figuring out how to properly scale my animated field. It also took me a little bit of time to figure out how to implement a way to evenly split the bill amonst 2,3 or 4 people, however, I'm impressed by the end result. Tinkering around with this field, I could see how one could implement different ways to split the bill based on user input.
